This is a simple tool that shows when you created the project¹, and how long you've been working² on that project.

¹Or when you imported the package into the project

²Counts the time unity is open

To use just import the package on your unity project, and it will start counting the time. The "Tools" menu and the "Time track" option will be created.

If you need to change any information(caution with this, if you change the string format, it will probably give an error), the file that is saved the infos is named timetrackdata.json, and it is saved in the path(windows only*): %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Packages\<productname>\TimeTrack

*You can check the path of other operating systems here: [PersistentDataPath Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html)

This tool is still in development, some updates are likely to happen in a near future. Feel free to report bugs and suggest improvements (:
